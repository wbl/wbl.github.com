  <h3><a href="/2021/03/11/anon.html">Anonymous transactions in Bitcoin</a>
  (11 March 2012)</h3>
  <p>I've written a paper at <a href="bitcoinanon.pdf">here</a> about
    creating anonymity for recipients of bitocoin transactions through blind
    signatures. The fundamental idea is to introduce a new opcode and signature
    type that can be used to restrict the order in which outputs of a script
    can be redeemed.</p>
  <p> This may or may not see wide support. It could be used by Bitcoin
    exchanges to protect their users further, but at a cost in computation
    time and complexity of redemption. We also need support from the blockchain
    which will mean some time to go from writing code to implementation</p>
  <p>In the future I hope to extend this to creating digital cash that is
    backed by Bitcoins: such cash would combine the tradtional advantages of
    digital currency in terms of ease of use and speed with the anti-inflation
    properties of Bitcoins.</p>
  <p>So let's talk about some uses of Bitcoins that aren't obvious. Let's
    say I want to demonstrate to you that I can spend some Bitcoins. My ability
    to spend Bitcoins is given by my possession of a public key. How can I
    demostrate my possession of a key without doing anything that might
    compromise my key?</p>
  <p>The quick answer is for me to send to you a random multiple of my public
    key, and then you ask me to prove that I know the discrete logarithm with
    respect to the standard base or with respect to my key. This leaks no
    information: given any transcript of the transaction, you could fake it.
